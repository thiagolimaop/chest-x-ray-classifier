# Chest X-Ray Image Classifier 

This project is about an image classifier categorizing chest X-Ray images as Pneumonia or Normal. For this was used a dataset found in Kaggle, using this [link here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2)

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project makes use of TensorFlow in Google Colab. To run this project, first, go to this [link here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2) and download the dataset named ChestXRay2017.zip. Then, move it to a folder in your Google Drive. After, run the code of the experiments in the order proposed below on [file Descriptions setion](#files).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My motivation for this project was to learn more about CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and augmentation techniques applying this knowledge to an area of my interest: Healthcare. 

## File Description<a name="files"></a>
- <b>Chest X-Ray Image Classifier.ipynb</b>: a notebook containing the initial understanding of the dataset and dividing it correctly to create the model and train it. This notebook also represents the initial experiment.
- <b>Chest X-Ray Image Classifier - II Trial.ipynb</b>: this notebook has the code to run the second experiment, which focuses on rotate augmentation.
- <b>Chest X-Ray Image Classifier - III Trial.ipynb</b>: this notebook has the code to run the third experiment, which focuses on zoom augmentation.
- <b>Chest X-Ray Image Classifier - IV Trial.ipynb</b>: this notebook has the code to run the fourth experiment, which focuses on brightness augmentation.
- <b>Chest X-Ray Image Classifier - V Trial.ipynb</b>: this notebook has the code to run the last experiment, which focuses on rotation and zoom augmentations together.
