## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project makes use of TensorFlow in Google Colab. The dataset was enabled in a public repository in google drive.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

My motivation for this project was to learn more about CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and augmentation techniques applying this knowledge to an area of my interest: Healthcare. 

## File Description<a name="files"></a>
- <b>ChestXRay.ipynb</b>: A notebook containing the initial understanding of the dataset, dividing it correctly to create the model and train it. Also, was used data augmentation in experiments.
